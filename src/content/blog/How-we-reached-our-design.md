From the beginning, it was clear that this project wasn’t about technology but about people.  
The main goal was for any user —regardless of age or experience— to use the platform confidently and without wasting time learning.

It was understood that the best technology is useless if people don’t feel comfortable using it. The focus was always on the real user experience.

## Always, the user first

Before writing a single line of code, the effort focused on understanding **who** would use the tool and **how**:

- Security guards who need speed and ease to react.
- Parents who want certainty that their children are safe and cared for.

It was identified that the audience is very diverse: a wide age range, different digital skills, and tech experience.  
Therefore, **simplicity, clarity, and ease of use were established as non-negotiable design principles**.

## The design path

1. **Listen:** meetings were held with all roles within the institution to understand real problems, concerns, and usage habits.
2. **Analyze:** patterns of behavior, fears of technology, concrete needs, and expectations were identified.
3. **Prototype:** quick and functional versions were created so users could test and give real feedback.
4. **Refine:** buttons were simplified, steps reduced, and anything that could cause confusion or delay was eliminated.
5. **Validate:** tests were carried out in real scenarios with real users before final launch to ensure everything worked as expected.

This iterative process allowed the design to evolve until perfectly fitting the reality of the end user.

## Key sections of the web

### Dashboard

The main panel instantly shows recent appointments and messages so users are always informed.  
It also includes a real-time map displaying the location of active cards across the campus, providing a quick and clear view of community movement.

This section was designed so that with a single glance, the current status is understood and quick action can be taken if needed, without wasting time navigating complicated menus.

---

### Graphs

Dynamic and visual charts display key information such as:

- Total number of active cards in the system.
- Battery percentage or charge level of these cards, to anticipate maintenance.

These charts allow guards and administrators to quickly interpret data and make informed decisions without reading lengthy or complicated reports.

### Chat

An internal chat was designed to directly connect guards with their supervisors, allowing agile and effective communication.  
This channel facilitates immediate coordination, avoids misunderstandings, and enables teams to react quickly to any incident or need arising daily.

---

### Appointments

There is a section exclusively dedicated to appointment management and monitoring.  
Guards can view detailed information about each scheduled appointment, its status, and if the appointment is in progress, a map shows the real-time location of the card associated with that person.

This helps maintain clear and effective control, optimizing surveillance and attention to visitors or authorized users.

### Parent Form

A module was created so the institution can generate customized forms that parents fill out to schedule appointments and request campus access.  
These requests appear directly in the system used by guards, who can review, approve, or manage them easily.

This feature streamlines administrative processes and improves security by controlling in advance who enters and when.

## Friendly design for everyone

The design is clean, with clear icons and easy-to-read text.  
There are no hidden menus or confusing functions.  
The goal was for anyone—from a teenager to a teacher with little digital experience—to use the platform within seconds, without complicated tutorials or constant assistance.

This approach made the tool accessible to a wide range of users, which is vital in a diverse educational environment.

## More than a design, a philosophy

It was not just about creating a visually attractive system but about developing a tool that supports, protects, and facilitates the daily life of an entire educational community.

It was always clear that if a user has to think too much to use the platform, something is wrong.  
Therefore, every design decision aimed to make the experience natural, fast, efficient, and frictionless.

Security is measured not only by technology but by the trust and comfort it generates in its users.
